# Python Task Manager
Designing a To Do List management system using KivyMD framework.
The application uses a custom dialog box to get task input from the user and adds it to a SQLite database. The saved tasks are displayed in a scrollable list with each item having a checkbox to mark it as complete or incomplete. The list items are also linked to the database primary keys for updating and deleting tasks.

The application loads the saved tasks from the database at the start and displays them on the screen. The theme of the application is set to "Orange". The code also includes a date picker that allows the user to select the date for the task.
